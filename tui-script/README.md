# QBeat TUI
An easy-to-use text-based interface for QBeat.

# Usage Walkthrough
QBeat TUI has a first-time setup utility, along with menus with features for daily use. To start QBeat TUI, run `./QBeat-tui` in your QBeat directory.

## First Time Setup
The first-time setup has 2 steps.

Firstly, you must set your config variables. You may hit `Tab` to autocomplete directories. When selecting the version, you will be presented with a list of versions. If the latest version does not appear, either it is not supported yet, or mods from the previous version are compatible with it.

Secondly, QBeat TUI will setup QBeat, which involves setting up the Wine prefix, installing the BSIPA mod, and patching the game. If everything is successful, you should have a modded setup of Beat Saber!

## Installing Mods
Now that you have patched the game with BSIPA, you may install mods. To do this, enter the `Mods` menu. If you would like to check which mods are compatible with your version of Beat Saber, do `List all available mods`. To install the mods of your choosing, do `Install mod(s)`. Here, you can enter a list of mods you want to install, each separated by a comma.
