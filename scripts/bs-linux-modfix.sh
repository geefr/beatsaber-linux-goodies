This script will setup beat saber mods on your system
Before running make sure the following have been done:
 - Wine is installed on your system
 - Your wine installation supports .Net 4.6.1 or higher
 - Beat Saber has been installed through steam
 - Beat Saber has been run/played at least once
 - BeatDrop or ModAssistant has been run, and the BSIPA mod has been installed (Don't worry if IPA.exe didn't patch correctly, we'll handle that here
 - Ideally that the copy of proton passed to this script has not been modified, or if so has been reinstalled through steam first (Feel free to try with a dirty copy, might be bugs in that case)

To run this script you need to pass 2 arguments:
 - The installation folder of beat saber itself e.g SteamApps/common/Beat Saber
 - The installation folder of the Proton version you want to use e.g SteamApps/common/Proton 4.11

The Proton installation will be copied to ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/Proton BeatSaber
TODO: To workaround https://github.com/beat-saber-modding-group/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded/issues/18 this script will modify SteamApps/compatdata/620980. If something doesn't work right just delete this folder and validate your beat saber installation

After running this script you will need to
 - Restart Steam
 - Change the proton version user for beat saber to 'Proton BeatSaber'
 - Go have fun <3
