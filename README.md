# Beat Saber Linux Goodies
Mod installation scripts and other goodies for running Beat Saber on Linux.

This repository is mainly for gathering information, and implementations of tools to make setup easier.

# Bugs/Support
If you're having issues on Linux the modding discord is fairly friendly, or raise a ticket here if it's an issue with my tools.

Please don't annoy the ModAssistant/mod devs directly, or at least be nice and don't expect full Linux support on everything.

# Why
# Install Method: QBeat
QBeat is currently under development still but is functional enough to get things working. 
If you'd prefer a GUI for installing mods then see the other methods below.

QBeat can be used to setup wine/proton, download mods, and patch beat saber in a relatively easy manner.
The scripts from method 2 are included with QBeat and will continue to be maintained for use with other mod installers.

# Install Method: Mod Installer + fix scripts
Mod Assistant or BeatDrop can also be used for mod installation, you'll just need to run scripts/bs-linux-modfix.sh after mod installation.
See the relevant folders here for a quick readme. Mod Assistant would be the best option here, should work fine as long as your wine install has .Net support.
